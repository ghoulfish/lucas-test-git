SVN initialize (can delete folder after initialization):
svn co https://svn.riouxsvn.com/lucas-test-svn
svn add trunk/new.txt 
svn ci -m "add new.txt"


git-svn initialize:
git svn clone https://svn.riouxsvn.com/lucas-test-svn/trunk
cd trunk
*git branch (check if the branch is master)







* = optional


# Clone a repo (like git clone):
        git svn clone https://svn.riouxsvn.com/lucas-test-svn/trunk
# Enter the newly cloned directory:
        cd trunk
# You should be on master branch, double-check with 'git branch'
        git branch
# Do some work and commit locally to Git:
        git commit ...
# Something is committed to SVN, rebase your local changes against the
# latest changes in SVN:
        git svn rebase
# Now commit your changes (that were committed previously using Git) to SVN,
# as well as automatically updating your working HEAD:
        git svn dcommit
